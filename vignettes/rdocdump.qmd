# Introduction

`{rdocdump}` is an R package designed to combine an R package’s documentation and vignettes into a single plain text file. This is particularly useful when you want to ingest complete package documentation into large language models (LLMs) or for archival purposes. `{rdocdump}` works with installed packages, source directories, tar.gz archives, or package sources available on CRAN.

# Installation

To install the development version of `{rdocdump}` from GitHub, run the following commands:

```r
# install.packages("pak") # Uncomment if pak is not installed
pak::pak("e-kotov/rdocdump")
```

# Setting the Cache Path

By default, `{rdocdump}` stores temporary files in a directory within R’s temporary directory. You can override this by setting a custom cache path using the helper function `rdd_set_cache_path()`. For example:

```r
# Set a custom cache directory
cache_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "my_rdocdump_cache")
rdd_set_cache_path(cache_dir)
```

```
rdocdump.cache_path set to: /private/var/folders/gb/t5zr5rn15sldqybrmqbyh6y80000gn/T/Rtmpp5wRxV/my_rdocdump_cache
```

This ensures that temporary tar.gz archives and extracted files are stored in your specified directory.

# Extracting Documentation

The main function in rdocdump is `rdd_to_txt()`, which accepts several types of inputs for the `pkg` argument:

- An installed package name (e.g., `"stats"`).

- A full path to a package source directory.

- A full path to a package archive (tar.gz).

- A package name available on CRAN (downloaded automatically if not installed).

Here is an example that downloads the source for the package `{rJavaEnv}` from CRAN, extracts its documentation, and saves it to a file:

```r
# Extract documentation for 'rJavaEnv' and save to a text file.
rdd_to_txt(
  pkg = "rJavaEnv",
  file = "rJavaEnv_docs.txt",
  force_fetch = TRUE,    # Force download even if the package is installed.
  keep_files = "none"      # Delete temporary files after extraction.
)
```

```
Fetching package source from CRAN...

```

If you prefer to simply get the combined documentation as a character string, call the function without the `file` argument:

```r
# Extract and capture the combined documentation in a variable.
docs <- rdd_to_txt(pkg = "stats")
cat(substr(docs, 1, 1000))  # Print the first 1000 characters for a preview.
```

```

Description:

     Generic function calculating Akaike's ‘An Information Criterion’

     value can be obtained, according to the formula -2*log-likelihood
     + k*npar, where npar represents the number of parameters in the
```

# Choosing what to dump to text

You can also choose if you want just the package documentaiton, just the vignettes, or both to be combined with the `content` argument:

```r
docs <- rdd_to_txt(
  pkg = "utils",
  content = "vignettes"
)
cat(substr(docs, 1, 1000))  # Print the first 1000 characters for a preview.
```

As you can see below, only the vignettes were combined:

# Handling Temporary Files

The argument keep_files controls whether temporary files (the downloaded archive and/or extracted directory) are retained:

- `"none"` (default): Delete both the tar.gz archive and the extracted files.

- `"tgz"`: Keep only the tar.gz archive.

- `"extracted"`: Keep only the extracted files.

- `"both"`: Keep both the tar.gz archive and the extracted files.

Choose the option that best fits your workflow.
