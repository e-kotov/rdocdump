Dump R documentation and vignettes of R packages into a single file. Supports installed packages, tar.gz archives, and package source directories. If the package is not installed, only its source is automatically downloaded from CRAN for processing. The output is a single plain text file or a 'character', which is useful to ingest complete package documentation into a large language model ('LLM').

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdocdump from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("e-kotov/rdocdump")
```

## Example

Extract documenation of `{rJavaEnv}` package by downloading source from CRAN and save it to file `rJavaEnv_docs.txt`

```r
rdd_to_txt(
  pkg = "rJavaEnv",
  file = "rJavaEnv_docs.txt",
  force_fetch = TRUE, # force download even if package is installed
  keep_files = "none" # delete temp files
)
```
