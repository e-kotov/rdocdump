Description: Dump source code, documentation and vignettes of R packages
    into a single file. Supports installed packages, tar.gz archives, and
    package source directories. If the package is not installed, only its
    source is automatically downloaded from CRAN for processing. The
    output is a single plain text file or a 'character', which is useful
    to ingest complete package documentation into a large language model
    ('LLM') or pass it further to other tools, such as 'ragnar'
    <https://github.com/tidyverse/ragnar> to create a Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) workflow.
